## Description
Getting root access can allow you to read the flag. Luckily there is a python file that you might like to play with.
Through Social engineering, we've got the credentials to use on the server. SSH is running on the server.

Username: picoctf

Password: EVf4z1Lz73

## Solution 

In the home/picoctf there is hidden python file "server.py" which basically makes a ping request but we can't run the file because we are not root. 
So according to the challenge description we need to become root. 

So we can use ```sudo -l``` to see what command and binaries the current user can use.
